# Brick Breaker iOS 13.x / MacOS 10.15
Simple ball game for iOS, and MacOS using Swift and Spritekit

I am building this simple game as a way of teaching myself Swift.  I have built a similar game on multiple platforms, so the logic is all well known to me.

This is very similar to the [BBTAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNPuYfMe6sw&t=14s) game where you launch balls at blocks.  The blocks have a number, if you hit them that number of times they disappear.  After each round you get one more ball, the blocks move down and you continue until the blocks hit the players launch area.
